# Welcome!

**`copier-cpp-cmake`** is project template based on [copier tool](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

The goal of **this** project is to provide an easy way to start with development of your new `C++` project and focus on
the problem you want to solve instead of project structure/code formatting/basic `CI` and other common "quality of life"
issues.

To get started go to [documentation section](/docs/intro)

## Why do I need a `C++` project template?

- **To reduce time spent on project setup**. Most of us want to focus on the problem/task we want to solve. Usually we either
need to spend some significant time to setup project properly or accept that some "nice to have" features like
`sanitizing` or `clang-format` will be missing at the beginning and "we will add it later".
- **To have an easy way to create sandbox for testing/prototypes**. we want to setup a `code kata` or test new library. Often
setting it up and getting needed dependency takes more time than we have or we need to lean on [](https://godbolt.org/)
omitting our local environment.
- **To enable less experienced users a fast start with all the benefits of external libraries/tooling**. In a lot of cases
students/less experienced people have hard time to start with `C++`. How much time would take you to run your first `
unit-test` starting from scratch?
- **To provide tools from the start of your project to deploy/share your software**. Lots of projects start with large
upfront effort without feedback loop from potential users. This can lead to misunderstanding users needs and high-efforts
for fixing this. Having a means to properly release your software from day one allows people to try it out and get involved
faster.
- **To have consistent project structure across multiple small projects developed by same people**. In your organization
you might have dozens of projects and in lots of cases contributing to each of them requires a slightly different set of
tools/another workflow. This leads to human-errors and time wasted on thinking "How should I run tests for this project"?
