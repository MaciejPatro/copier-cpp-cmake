# Welcome

**`copier-cpp-cmake`** is project template based on [copier tool](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Goals and philosophy

* The **main** goal of **this** project is to provide an easy way to start with development of your new `C++` project and focus on
the problem you want to solve instead of project structure/code formatting/basic `CI` and other common "quality of life"
issues. 
* The **secondary** goal is to make this project as **flexible** as reasonable. Allowing people to use different tools as they usually have different needs. 
* The **third** important aspect is to provide good `defaults` for each choice user can make (default to well established tools) so that less experienced users can use them as good starting point in their `C++` adventure.

What is **not** a goal of the project:
* Currently, it is not a goal to help you install/maintain all necessary tools on your machine. The project provides `docker` images for `CI/CD` which can be used during development - but taking care of having properly installed tools is your responsibility.
